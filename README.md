### Project overview
This project is basically about an e-commerce website that specialises in selling sneakers. This website does feature a user-friendly interface which allows the users to browse items such as sneakers and even gift cards for themselves and even their family members. This project also ensures that the website includes responsive design so that users can view the website at any time without facing any disruption. Hence, this improves the user experience. This website also takes care of accessibility making sure that people that have certain disabilities such as needing to use the screen reader will still be able to use this website efficiently.
### Design Process
For my design process, initially, I wanted to design an e-commerce shoe shop just like the current one in Nike. Then I saw  a reference website online and decided to make something similar to it. I wanted the design to maintain a clean look and not too bright colors as it can be very contrasting. So for this design i just went with more basic colors such as white, black and grey for most of my design. My design is also meant to be minimalist with not much extra design cluttering up the space, making it look like a mess. This will help me to maintain the simple and clean look that i wanted from the start. Moving on, this website is designed for sneaker enthusiasts and people who are looking for high-quality sneakers. The target audience can range from both men to women, old and young as there are different sneakers to fit different genders and ages. Users often want to browse through a variety of products and be able to checkout as quickly as possible. Users also want to make sure that their checkout is secure before leaving the page. The website that i design includes a large variety of products, a quick and efficient checkout with the payment being secure as I would need the user to click to confirm the order before returning them to the homepage.
